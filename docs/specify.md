/specify Build a cross-platform, HIPAA-compliant desktop and mobile/tablet application for therapy compliance analysis. The app supports multi-format document ingestion (PDF, Word, Excel, scanned images), performs OCR and parsing, and applies advanced AI models (ClinicalBERT, BioBERT, AraG) for deep semantic and clinical concept analysis. Users can upload, select, and manage multiple compliance rubrics (PDF, DOCX, XLSX), apply rubric-based evaluations per discipline (PT/OT/ST). Reports feature automated citation extraction with meta-data and direct source navigation, and generate annotated, audit-ready PDF reports including strengths, weaknesses, findings, and improvement suggestions. Reports are auto-purged after 24 hours for security, while anonymized meta-data is retained for analytics and trending dashboards, which are available separately for directors/admins. Additional features: offline AI chatbox for compliance/documentation help, built-in training/educational modules, PHI scrubbing, encrypted storage, audit logging, secure login, and automatic updates. The UI adapts for desktop, tablet, and mobile, with prioritization of precise analysis and reporting when hardware resources are limited.
