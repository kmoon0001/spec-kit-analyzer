- Keep the existing design, look, feel, and features intact; focus on bug fixes and code cleanliness unless explicitly approved otherwise.
- Use industry best practices and advanced, maintainable patterns where they add value.
- Maintain PySide-equivalent features while transitioning to Electron/React, preserving full functionality and interactivity; retire PySide assets only once parity is achieved.
- Document milestones and persist progress after each major step while re-reading relevant modules to keep full-codebase context active.
- Consolidate and deduplicate rules or logic when possible, simplifying imports and helpers without altering behavior.
- Keep pytest markers intact and prevent test collection from environments or build artifacts (virtualenvs, caches, coverage outputs, frontend builds, etc.).
- Harden code and tests defensively as you go, ensuring resilience across the entire codebase.
